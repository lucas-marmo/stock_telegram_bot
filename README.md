# Stock Telegram Bot
This project aims to use a Telegram Bot to send stock information by using a Flask App y Python. At the same time it sends information by Telegram, it also shows a user interface where you can select which company's stock price you want to know.

### How to run
Add on the root a `config.py` file with the following keys:

TOKEN = `'string'`

CHAT_ID = `integer`

To know your bot's token, ask it to @BotFather
To know your chat's id, ask it to @useridinfobot by sending the command `/start`
